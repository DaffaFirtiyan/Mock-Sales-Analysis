# Mock Sales Analysis
I've started this little project where I want to put all the skills I learned during university to the test. It's going to be a case study of what I might encounter in the industry. My goal is to showcase my abilities while also learning and growing my skills.

For this project, I'm going to use agile methodologies, which I learned in INFO226, to tackle the business requirements. I'll be using Microsoft SQL Server Management for data queries, which was covered in DATA202. I'll be building an interactive dashboard using PowerBI. Finally, I'll be using ChatGPT to help me come up with prompts for business problems/requirements.

I'm using the AdventureWorks database, which is a sample database created by Microsoft. This database simulates a bike manufacturing company and contains useful data on sales, production, human resources, and more. One of the plus side about using the AdventureWorks database is that ChatGPT is familiar with it, so it can generate relevant business requests that are specific to the database.

# Business Request
I asked ChatGPT to write a sample email from a sales manager, requesting a dashboard based on the AdventureWorks database. This is what it came out as and what I'll base my dashboard off of.

`Subject: Request to improve Internet sales reports`

`Hi Daffa,`

`I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to you to discuss the improvement of our Internet sales reports. As the sales manager, I believe that we need to move from static reports to visual dashboards to enhance our reporting capabilities.`

`Our goal is to focus on how much we have sold of what products, to which clients, and how sales have been over time. As each salesperson works with different products and customers, it would be beneficial to have the ability to filter them.`

`To help with our analysis, I have added a spreadsheet to measure our numbers against budget. This will enable us to compare our values against performance. The budget is for 2021, and we usually look two years back in time when analyzing sales.`

`Please let me know if there is anything else you need from me to make this project a success. I appreciate your hard work and dedication to improving our sales analysis.`

`Best regards,`

`Sales Manager`
